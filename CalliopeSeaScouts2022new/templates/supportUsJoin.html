        The programme provided is as wide and varied as possible. Several outdoor tramping/camping weekends are usually
        arranged each year; there is an annual Sea Scouts Regatta where all troops in the region compete with their sailing
        skills; on summer evenings training and sailing experience is gained with the use of the Group's Cutter, Sunbursts,
        Fevas, catamaran and kayaks. Winter months see the children working on badges (covering a wide range of topics,
        community issues and skills ), ropework, first aid, and games plus the inevitable Boat Maintenance under the
        watchful eye of a local boatbuilder.
        <br><br>
        Every four years a National Jamboree is held - this means that every Scout has at least one opportunity to attend whilst
        in the Scouting movement. Scouts gather from around New Zealand and the Pacific in one giant tent city where activities
        aimed to interest, challenge and excite are provided.
        <br><br>
        The Scout Leader will provide a more comprehensive joining kit and information once your son/daughter has decided to join.
        The Group also ensures that all those involved are kept informed of all activities, with the normal Cub/Scout handouts
        relating to programmes etc.

        <p>
        Venturers' program is as wide and varied as the Venturers are willing to plan for and organise (within reason).
        Venturers generally meet weekly to do sailing during summer, while in Winter Venturers meet weekly to do activities
        that they plan and organise while being overseen by the Venturer Leader, and helped out by Assistant Leaders and parents.
